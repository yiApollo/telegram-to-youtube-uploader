## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Not Use API for Upload?

Due to YouTube Data API limitations:

* **Uploads via API (free)**: limited to **6 videos/day**
* **Playlist management via API**: allows **100+ videos/day**

**We only use the API to organize videos ‚Äî not to upload them.**

### 5. AI Summarization

Use [YouTube Transcript Extractor](https://github.com/yiApollo/YouTube-Transcript-Extractor-Auto-Whisper-Fallback)

Simply upload the complete `.md` file with full playlist transcripts‚Äîor only the specific `.md` files you need‚Äîto Google NotebookLM, ChatGPT, or your preferred AI, and ask for a summary.

This tool wasn't built for summarizing individual videos‚Äîthere are already many tools for that. It was designed specifically to help summarize entire playlists of content and courses from YouTube.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

The YouTube organizer script relies on **exact video titles** to work correctly. It only processes videos with titles in the following format:

```text
Lesson 1
Lesson 2
```

If your videos do not follow this format, they will be ignored.

To ensure proper detection and organization:

    Upload your videos with titles like Lesson 1, Lesson 2, etc.

    The script will automatically rename them to:

Lesson 1 - ChannelName

And include them in the playlist.
